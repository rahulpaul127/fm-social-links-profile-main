## My Process

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- @font-face rule for custom local fonts
- clamp() for fluid typography and responsive sizing

## What I learned

This project was all about clamp(). It was kinda confusing at first, but I got to know it more deeply now. It saves a lot of time by handling responsiveness in one line, which means no more writing multiple @media queries. It was great to learn.

## Continued development

I'm excited to learn more things and definitely want to keep using clamp() until it feels effortless and natural to use.

```css
.social-container {
  width: clamp(0rem, 100vw - 40px, 23.75rem);
}
```
